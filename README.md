# Project Doors
Test Build for Project

This Unreal project is under development by 'AFO Studio' (atm just Cory Brown)
This is also partly a homework assignment for my CIT 447 course at Marshall University.

The story for Project Doors is underdevelopment and not ready for release, but will be heavily influenced by Bioshock, Silent Hills(PT) and some movies held dear to the writer/designer (also just Cory Brown).

First-Person Shooter/Puzzle game
Want to eventually include RPG aspects
